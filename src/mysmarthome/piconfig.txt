Help file for the config editor 

only very little help at this moment:

Double click on an entry in the gui list or device list, if you want to edit it.
Double click on an entry in the rules editor to edit the rule.
If you want to integrate a new protokoll or device, you can create a file that 
consists the json element. All values that can be edited must be \s for strings,
\i for integers and \f for floats. For examples see the protocol files in the 
"Template" directory.
